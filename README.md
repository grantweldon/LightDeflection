This is a simple VPython simulation demonstrating the gravitational deflection of light and gravitational redshift. The model uses a Newtonian approximation by treating a photon as a particle accelerated by the gravitational force of a black hole. The Newtonian deflection angle, observed in the simulation, is 1/2 of the GR deflection angle. Furthermore, while photons cannot truly be accelerated past c, gravitational redshift occurs, as represented visually in the simulation.

This simulation is useful to introduce basic numerical methods, the role of approximation in physics, Newtonian gravitational phenomena, and qualitative GR / astrophysics concepts (gravitational lensing, redshift, black holes, etc).
